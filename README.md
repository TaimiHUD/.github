# TaimiHUD

TaimiHUD is a Nexus and ArcDPS addon that provides functionality generally only seen on Windows, provided by TacO, BlishHUD, etc. It was made with the intention of providing a similar feature set to those of us on Linux and to those of us who did not want an overlay window, but something rendering within the game. Despite the intention of Linux support, TaimiHUD is cross-platform!
